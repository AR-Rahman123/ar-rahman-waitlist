## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **Landing Page** (`/`) - Main marketing page with hero section, local video player, and waitlist CTA
2. **Waitlist Form** - Multi-step form collecting user demographics and preferences
3. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`) - ScoreApp-style analytics with multi-select deletion, CSV export, and visual charts
4. **UI Components** - Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library

### Backend Components
1. **API Routes** - RESTful endpoints for waitlist management
2. **Database Layer** - Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL integration
3. **Email Service** - SendGrid integration for automated emails
4. **Storage Layer** - Abstracted storage interface for data operations

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user management (id, username, password)
- **Waitlist Responses Table**: Comprehensive user survey data including demographics, prayer habits, Arabic understanding, and feature preferences

## Data Flow

### Waitlist Signup Flow
1. User fills out multi-step waitlist form
2. Frontend validates data using Zod schemas
3. Data submitted to `/api/waitlist` endpoint
4. Backend validates and stores data in PostgreSQL
5. Welcome email sent to user via SendGrid
6. Admin notification email sent
7. Success confirmation displayed to user

### Analytics Flow
1. Admin accesses dashboard at `/admin`
2. Frontend fetches analytics data from `/api/waitlist/analytics`
3. Data aggregated and displayed in dashboard components
4. Real-time updates via React Query

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: SendGrid API key for emails
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Sender email address
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin notification email

### Production Considerations
- Frontend served as static files from `dist/public`
- Backend runs on Node.js server
- Database hosted on Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- Email delivery through SendGrid service

### Development Features
- Hot module replacement via Vite
- Real-time error overlay
- Replit integration for cloud development
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

- **Current Status**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Login works, all 12 responses display correctly, export/delete functionality restored

### Complete Dashboard Data Display Fix (July 15, 2025)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Cookie credentials not being sent with fetch requests to authenticated endpoints
- **Solution Implemented**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to all API calls for proper session handling
- **Functionality Restored**:

- **Root Cause**: Drizzle ORM query limitation or production database connection truncation
- **Solution Implemented**: Direct database bypass with raw SQL queries for guaranteed data retrieval
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive response parsing and raw text analysis
- **Status**: Critical fix deployed to resolve persistent 3/12 response limitation affecting admin dashboard

### Production Deployment Fix - Netlify Function Update (July 15, 2025)
- **Critical Discovery**: Production site (ar-rahman.ai) using Netlify serverless functions with hardcoded 3 responses
- **Root Cause**: Netlify function in `/netlify/functions/api.js` only contained partial data (IDs 12, 11, 10)
- **Solution**: Updated Netlify function with all 12 authentic responses from local database
- **Data Sync**: Production now matches local development with complete Omar Shahid, Ibrahim Malik, and Farhad Malik entries
- **Authentication**: Enhanced serverless auth middleware for proper session handling
- **Impact**: Production admin dashboard will now display all 12 responses instead of truncated 3

### Dynamic Submission Tracking Implementation (July 15, 2025)
