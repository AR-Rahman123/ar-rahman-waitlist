# Deployment Status Update

## Progress Made ✅
- **API Function Loading**: Serverless function now responds (no more 502 errors)
- **ES Module Error Fixed**: Import syntax error resolved
- **Error Detection Improved**: Now getting specific path resolution errors

## Current Issue ❌
```
"Cannot find module '/var/task/dist/index.js' imported from /var/task/netlify/functions/server.js"
```

## Root Cause
The `dist/index.js` file is not being included in the Netlify deployment package.

## Fixes Applied
1. **Added `included_files`** in netlify.toml to ensure dist/ folder is deployed
2. **Enhanced path resolution** in serverless function to try multiple import paths
3. **Improved error logging** to debug path issues

## Expected Result
After next deployment, the serverless function should:
1. Find the Express app at one of the tested paths
2. Successfully import and serve API endpoints
3. Allow form submissions to work properly

## Next Step
Deploy these configuration fixes to resolve the missing module path issue.
