# Deployment Status - July 15, 2025

## Current Status

### ✅ Successful Components
- **GitHub Repository**: Latest changes pushed successfully (commit b2821d9)
- **Domain Resolution**: ar-rahman.ai is accessible
- **Website Loading**: Content displays correctly
- **Git Issues**: Resolved - commits are now reaching GitHub

### ⚠️ Pending Deployment
- **Form Stability Fixes**: Not yet deployed to production
- **HMR-resistant form handling**: Still needed on live site
- **Real-time validation**: Not active on ar-rahman.ai

### Next Steps Required

1. **Trigger Netlify Rebuild**
   - Netlify may need manual trigger to pick up latest GitHub changes
   - Check Netlify dashboard for build status

2. **Verify Auto-Deploy Settings**
   - Ensure Netlify is watching the main branch
   - Confirm build hooks are functioning

3. **Test Form Submission**
   - Once deployed, test waitlist form for stability
   - Verify no more inconsistent behavior

### Expected Timeline
- Netlify typically deploys within 2-5 minutes of GitHub push
- If no auto-deploy after 10 minutes, manual trigger needed

### Form Fix Details
The key changes waiting for deployment:
- Button type changed from "submit" to "button" for stability
- Added mode: "onChange" for real-time validation
- Direct onClick handling to prevent HMR issues
