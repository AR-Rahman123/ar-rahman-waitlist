- **Netlify Server**: Active and responding
- **SSL Certificate**: Valid (HTTPS working)
- **Redirect**: HTTP properly redirects to HTTPS
- **Content Delivery**: Website content loading

### ⚠️ Client-Side Issue
The domain is working from server perspective but not accessible from your location.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. DNS Propagation Delay
- **Cause**: Recent DNS changes taking time to propagate globally
- **Solution**: Wait 1-2 hours or try different DNS servers
- **Test**: Try accessing from different device/network

### 2. Local DNS Cache
- **Cause**: Your computer/network cached old DNS records
- **Solutions**:
  - Clear browser cache and DNS cache
  - Try incognito/private browsing mode
  - Restart browser completely

### 3. ISP/Network Blocking
- **Cause**: Your ISP or network blocking the domain
- **Solutions**:
  - Try mobile data instead of WiFi
  - Use VPN to different location
  - Try from different network

### 4. Netlify Domain Configuration
- **Cause**: Domain pointing to wrong Netlify site
- **Check**: Verify in Netlify dashboard that ar-rahman.ai points to correct site

## Immediate Testing Steps

1. **Try Alternative URLs**:
   - Direct Netlify URL: `[your-site-name].netlify.app`
   - Check if that works instead

2. **Test from Different Sources**:
   - Mobile device on cellular data
   - Different computer/network
   - Ask someone else to test the domain

3. **Browser Troubleshooting**:
   - Clear all browser data for ar-rahman.ai
   - Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Disable browser extensions temporarily

## Domain Verification
From server side, the domain is responding correctly:
- Status: HTTP/2 200 OK
- SSL: Valid certificate
- Content: Website loading properly
- Server: Netlify responding normally

The issue appears to be on the client/network side rather than server configuration.
