# One-Button Deployment Setup

## Current Status:
✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** configured (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
✅ **Netlify configuration** ready (`netlify.toml`)
✅ **Video player** working with Vimeo embed
✅ **Application** tested and functional
❌ **Git connection** blocked by Replit restrictions

## Solution: Use Replit's GitHub Integration

### Step 1: Connect Replit to GitHub
1. **In Replit**: Click the **Version Control** tab (Git icon) in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Connect to GitHub"**
3. **Select your repository**: `AR-Rahman123/ar-rahman-waitlist`
4. **Click "Connect"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code
1. **In the Version Control tab**: You'll see your changed files
2. **Write commit message**: "Fixed video player and enhanced analytics"
3. **Click "Commit & Push"**

### Step 3: Configure Netlify Secrets
Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify API token
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your site ID from Netlify
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key (when ready)
- `FROM_EMAIL`: help@ar-rahman.ai
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Your admin email

### Step 4: Deploy
Once pushed, GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. **Build your application** (`npm run build`)
2. **Deploy to Netlify**
3. **Make it live** at www.ar-rahman.ai

## One-Button Process:
After initial setup, every future update is just:
1. **Make changes in Replit**
2. **Version Control tab → Commit & Push**
3. **Automatic deployment** happens in ~3 minutes

This bypasses all Git CLI restrictions and gives you the one-button deployment you want.
