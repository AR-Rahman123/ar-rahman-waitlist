# Critical API Fix Required - Netlify Functions

## Issue
- Website loads correctly ✅
- API endpoints return 404 ❌
- Form submission fails with "Failed to join waitlist" ❌
- Serverless functions not working on Netlify

## Root Cause
Netlify deployment is serving static frontend but backend API routes are not accessible.
This suggests the serverless function configuration or build is failing.

## Immediate Fix Steps

### 1. Check Build Status
- Verify `dist/index.js` exists after build
- Ensure serverless function can import the Express app
- Check for build errors in Netlify logs

### 2. Test Serverless Function
The function should be accessible at:
`https://ar-rahman.ai/.netlify/functions/server/api/waitlist`

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure Netlify has all required environment variables:
- DATABASE_URL
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- FROM_EMAIL
- ADMIN_EMAIL

### 4. Force Rebuild
After fixing function configuration, trigger new Netlify build.

## Status
- Frontend: Working ✅
- Backend: Not accessible ❌
- Priority: CRITICAL - Users cannot submit forms
