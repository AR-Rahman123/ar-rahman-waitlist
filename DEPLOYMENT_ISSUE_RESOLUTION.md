# Deployment Issue Resolution Guide

## Current Status (July 15, 2025)

### Problem Summary
- Domain ar-rahman.ai is accessible but showing older version
- Git repository is locked (`.git/index.lock` issue)
- Recent form stability fixes haven't been deployed
- Netlify isn't receiving updated code

### Root Cause
Git lock file preventing code pushes to GitHub, which blocks Netlify auto-deployment.

### Manual Resolution Steps

1. **Fix Git Lock Issue**
   ```bash
   rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock
   killall git
   git status
   ```

2. **Push Recent Changes**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix form submission stability and prevent HMR-related failures"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Netlify Deployment**
   - Check GitHub repository for recent commits
   - Verify Netlify build logs
   - Test domain ar-rahman.ai for updated functionality

### Key Changes Pending Deployment
- Form submission stability improvements
- HMR-resistant form handling
- Enhanced error logging and validation
- Real-time form validation mode

### Alternative Deployment
If Git issues persist, manually upload files:
1. Download project as ZIP
2. Upload to GitHub via web interface
3. Netlify will auto-deploy from GitHub

### Domain Status
✅ ar-rahman.ai is resolving correctly
✅ Netlify hosting is active
⚠️ Code deployment pipeline is blocked by Git lock
