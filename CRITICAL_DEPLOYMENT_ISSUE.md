# CRITICAL: Emergency API Fix Deployed

## Issue Resolution Strategy
The original serverless function approach was failing due to complex import dependencies. I've created a standalone API function that bypasses these issues entirely.

## Changes Made
1. **Created `netlify/functions/api.js`** - Standalone API function with direct database access
2. **Updated `netlify.toml`** - Redirects now point to the new API function
3. **Eliminated import dependencies** - No more complex Express app imports

## How It Works
- Form submissions go to `/api/waitlist` → `/.netlify/functions/api/waitlist`
- Direct database operations without importing the full Express app
- Simplified error handling and logging

## Expected Result
After this deployment:
- API endpoints should respond correctly
- Form submissions should work
- "Failed to join waitlist" error should be resolved

## Deployment Status
- Git commit: ✅ Completed
- Push to main: ✅ Completed  
- Netlify build: ⏳ In progress
- Test required: After build completes

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Netlify build completion (2-3 minutes)
2. Test form submission on ar-rahman.ai
3. Verify waitlist count endpoint works

This is a critical fix that should resolve the API issues once and for all.
